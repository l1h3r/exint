[carrying_add]
overview = """
Calculates `self` + `rhs` + `carry` and checks for overflow.

Performs "ternary addition" of two integer operands and a carry-in bit, and
returns a tuple of the sum along with a boolean indicating whether an arithmetic
overflow would occur. On overflow, the wrapped value is returned.

This allows chaining together multiple additions to create a wider addition, and
can be useful for bignum addition. This method should only be used for the most
significant word; for the less significant words the unsigned method
[`uint::carrying_add`] should be used.

The output boolean returned by this method is *not* a carry flag, and should
*not* be added to a more significant word.

If the input carry is false, this method is equivalent to [`overflowing_add`].

Calculates the "full multiplication" `self * rhs + carry` without the possibility to overflow.

multiple multiplications to create "big integers" which represent larger values.
